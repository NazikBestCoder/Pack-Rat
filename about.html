          <p class="mb-2">
            Phil graduated with a BS in Music Education from Duquesne University
            in 2013. He taught in Pittsburgh Catholic Grade Schools and at a
            local High School for about 5-6 years. He has not taught in schools
            since that high school job and currently is working in Tech Support
            for ZOLL Medical Corporation working specifically with the LifeVest,
            a wearable defibrillator. He took this Boot Camp to prepare for a
            career pivot into CS and is very excited to start working on an App
            design with a coder friend. In his free time, he enjoys video and
            tabletop gaming, reading, watching movies/TV shows, and he is an
            avid follower of the Pittsburgh Penguins hockey team.

          <p class="mb-2">
            Lia is an aspiring full-stack web developer from Newark, Delaware.
            She also recently graduated with a BA in Media Communication from
            the University of Delaware. Shortly before graduating though, Lia
            realized she wanted to be challenged more technically in her work,
            so she decided on a whim to take a basic computer science class last
            semester. From then on, Lia fell in love with coding and knew it was
            something she wanted to pursue further. Currently Lia is attending
            the University of Pennsylvania LPS Coding Boot Camp, and plans to
            look for a full-time position in the web development field after
            graduation.

          <p class="mb-2">
            Nazik moved from Kazakhstan to Philadelphia awhile ago. She is 22
            and in search of a steady, interesting job to support her and her
            crazy ideas and passions. Nazik quit college because it seems not to
            be worthy of its tuition and time. In her free time, she creates
            motion design and Youtube videos. She is stressing out a bit for
            choosing this route in life instead of listening to everyone and
            becoming a doctor. Nazik hopes everything will work out eventually
            and will get to know everyone. She wishes everyone a lot of patience
            to go through the bootcamp successfully.

          <h2 class="mb-2 mt-6">Andrew Currie</h2>
          <p class="mb-2">
            Born in Missouri and raised in Arizona, he spent many of his adult
            years looking for his tribe, and has finally found them in the field
            of programming! His first time experiencing the joys (and headaches)
            of coding was when he was eleven years old. At that time his school
            was working with HTML 3.2, doing all styling in-line. He continued
            playing around with HTML and CSS for many years and now he's back at
            it with the LPS UPenn Coding Bootcamp! He served in the U.S. Army
            for five years straight out of high school, learning much about the
            world during that time. After that chapter had closed, he began
            searching for his next adventure in past passions. He started self
            educating in C++ and eventually Python to see if it was an activity
            he still enjoyed. The excitement was still present with every new
            hurdle passed and knowledge gained. He is thrilled to be a part of
            the challenging curriculum with the wonderful staff that is here to
            help transform him into a full-fledged web developer!
